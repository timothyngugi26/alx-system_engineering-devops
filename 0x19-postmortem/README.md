Summary of Incident
On August 1, 2024, at about 15:00 EAT, a critical deployment was scheduled. Everything was going smoothly until it came time to log into the web server. That’s when the team realized the unthinkable: the logins had been forgotten! What followed was an hour-long saga of frantic password guessing, multiple failed attempts, and eventually, a sheepish call to IT. The incident led to a delay in deployment and some much-needed reflection on the importance of password management.

Impact
- Deployment Delay: 1 hour.
- Team Morale:Temporarily reduced, but quickly rebounded with humor and some snacks.
- Productivity:Slight dip due to the unexpected downtime and distraction.
- Reputation Impact: Thankfully, contained within the team, but let’s just say this won’t be forgotten soon.

Root Cause Analysis
The root cause was simple: the login credentials were misplaced, forgotten, or otherwise unattainable. Whether it was an over-reliance on memory or just bad luck, the lack of access brought everything to a screeching halt:
- Password Mismanagement:The credentials were either not stored securely or not stored at all. The memory of the password was apparently as reliable as a matatu schedule.
- Lack of Backup:There was no alternative method to quickly recover or reset the password, which meant we were stuck in a loop of frustration.

Timeline of Events
-15:00 EAT:Team attempted to log into the web server for a scheduled deployment.
-15:05 EAT: First realization that the password was not at hand.
-15:15 EAT: After several failed attempts, panic began to set in.
-15:30 EAT: Team considered trying every password ever used since 2010.
- 15:45 EAT: Finally, a call was made to IT (after admitting defeat).
- 16:00 EAT: IT provided the correct credentials, and the deployment was completed smoothly thereafter.

Immediate Response & Actions Taken
- Password Recovery:After the initial shock wore off, we contacted IT, who graciously provided the forgotten credentials without too much teasing.
- Documentation:The correct login credentials were immediately stored securely in our password manager—never to be forgotten again (hopefully).

Root Cause Fixes & Long-Term Improvements
- Password Management System: We’ve now ensured that all critical credentials are securely stored in a centralized password manager that the whole team can access (with proper permissions, of course).
- Backup Access: We’ve implemented a backup process, so if someone forgets the logins again, we can recover them faster than it takes to find a matatu when it’s raining.

Lessons Learned
- Don’t Rely on Memory: Human memory is fallible, especially when it comes to complex passwords. Let’s leave the memory games to our social lives.
- Use Password Managers:They exist for a reason, and now we fully appreciate why.
- Always Have a Backup: Having a backup plan for password recovery is just as important as having the passwords themselves.

Action Items
-Immediate:
  - Store all critical passwords in the password manager.
  - Ensure all team members are familiar with the backup recovery process.
  
- Long-Term:
  - Regularly audit and update our password management practices.
  - Train the team on the importance of secure and accessible password storage.
  - Reward IT with snacks for their timely help!

Conclusion
This incident was a reminder that even the most skilled team can be brought to a standstill by something as small as a forgotten password. But with a bit of humor, a lot of learning, and some proper password management tools, we’re confident that this will be the last time we’re locked out of our own servers.

step to take 
A follow-up meeting is scheduled for August 20, 2024, where we’ll review our new password management practices and share a few laughs about this whole situation.
